(1) write the cloud version for training model
(2) set up robustness experiment for the rest 8 classes in noise3 and noise4
(4) write quantile code and generate new table for compare quantile and density --dataset --novel_ratio

(3) use extracted gt features for cifar10 to training model
(4) plot graph for cifar-gth, analyze every epoch
(5) extract gt features for fmnist (doing local)
(6) fmnist-gth training
(7) fmnist-gth plot
(9) extract gt features for mnist(doing cloud)

(8) select an experiment to plot the histgrams of llk in the training set

Finally, summarize all the results
